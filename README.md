audible-proximity
=================

Programatically play audio files on a portable computer, like the Raspberry Pi, based on its proximity to Bluetooth beacons.  If using a Pi, our [Prepare a headless Raspberry Pi from scratch](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pi-prep/) is the ideal starting point. 



Pulse-Audio
-----------

To get Bluetooth headphones working, try this:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install mpg123
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
sudo usermod -G bluetooth -a pi
pulseaudio --start
Run the bluetoothctl for initial setup of device (note, weâ€™ll need to test the process of setting up the relationship between the device and the pi
bluetoothctl
```
SET up pi to auto-login (using raspi-config), this will help the headphones connect




Installation
------------

Clone this repository, and from its root folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

If using a Pi, we recommend installing as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/donundeen/audible-proximity.git
cd audible-proximity
npm install
```


Quick Start
-----------

To start __audible-proximity__ run `npm start` again from the root folder.

If an EPERM error is encountered, follow the instructions for [assigning privileges](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl-hci/#assigning-privileges) in barnowl-hci.


Prerequisites
-------------

__audible-proximity__ requires the [mpg123](https://www.mpg123.de/) lightweight media player, which can easily be installed on Ubuntu/Debian Linux distributions (such as that on a Raspberry Pi) with the command `sudo apt install mpg123`


Audio Files
-----------

By default, audio files are expected to be found in the data/audio subfolder of this repository and have the form __xxxxxxx.mp3__ where each 'x' is a hexadecimal character (0-9 or a-f), for example 0123abc.mp3.

A Bluetooth beacon transmitting an [InteroperaBLE Identifier](https://reelyactive.github.io/interoperable-identifier/) with the entity UUID __496f4944-434f-4445-b73e-2e2f2e6d7033__ will have its 28-bit instance ID interpreted as the filename of the associated .mp3 file.

An audio file is included to facilitate out-of-the-box testing (data/audio/0000000.mp3).  To trigger this audio file, configure a Bluetooth beacon (or a beacon simulator app for mobile devices) as Eddystone-UID with the following parameters:
- _Namespace ID:_ 496f49442e2f2e6d7033
- _Instance ID:_ 000000000000


Debug Mode
----------

Alternatively, start __audible-proximity__ with the command `npm run debug` to print status updates to the console for debugging and to facilitate the tweaking of parameters.


Run-on-Boot
-----------

To run __audible-proximity__ automatically every time the Pi boots up:
- `loginctl enable-linger pi`
- Copy the unit file to the systemd system folder with the command `sudo cp units/audible-proximity-pi.service /lib/systemd/user/`
- Enable the audible-proximity service with the command ` systemctl --user enable audible-proximity-pi.service`
- Start the audible-proximity service with the command `systemctl --user start audible-proximity-pi.service`

Note that it may be necessary to edit the WorkingDirectory and/or ExecStart paths to match the installed location of the __audible-proximity__ repository and npm, respectively.
